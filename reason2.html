        <h2> Reason 2: Other activities</h2>
        <p>
            Sketching, watching movies, working out, writing, furthering GIS skills. All of these things which I enjoy require more time than that which I have in a given day.
            More than an excuse I think of it as an <em>opportunity</em> to organize my time better. Not much to say here, if there are people who are attached to things they have, I could say that I am somewhat attached to <em>the things I do.</em>
