        <h2> Reason 3: Work and school</h2>
        <p>
            As a student and a worker I spend most of my day either doing homework/in class or working, currently I work in two different jobs making time management extra tricky.
            Now, I am not arguing that reading <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> is more important than my schoolwork <del>it kinda is</del>. I am merely being objective on the <em>reasons</em> why I haven't finished the book.
