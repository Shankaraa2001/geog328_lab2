        <p>At the beginning of summer I was committed to start my reading ~again~, of the <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>.
        I was excited and decided to dive into the mysteries and enigmas of this <sub>extraordinarily</sub>special book. Being a <strong>Philosophical Novel</strong>, this story explores the <strong>human condition:</strong>
        <em>desire</em>, <em>love</em>, <em>faith</em>, <em>hate</em>, <em>fear</em> without any hesitancy. At first I was completely blind to its sublime richness and <em>depth</em>, this was the first time I "tried" to read it. This time was different.
        Every page is an adventure, and I have enjoyed all of it.
        <strong>Paradoxical as it sounds I have not finished it...</strong>
        Fully aware that this does not really interest anyone but me <strong>and/but</strong> due to a lack of inspiration <del>and probably some guilt.</del> I intend to explore this situation that I find myself in.</p>
