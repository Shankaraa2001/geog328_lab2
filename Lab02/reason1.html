    <h2> Reason 1: Other readings</h2>
    <p>
        I have a terrible habit <sub>and I do mean terrible</sub> of buying books non-stop.
         And the <em>reasons</em> behind such impulse are extraordinarily <em>random</em>. I might enjoy the <em>title</em> or the image in the <em>front page</em>, maybe the <em>name</em> of the author sounds familiar or the <em>genre</em> interests me. It does not matter, <em>everypart</em> of a book is an invitation.
        Currently due to <strong>Dostoevsky's</strong> influence I find myself <em>fascinated</em> by the context in which <strong>Russian literature</strong> developed through <em>time.
        </em> So, ~~why not?~~ I am also reading <em>A Cultural History of Russian Literature.</em>
